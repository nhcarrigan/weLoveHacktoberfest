Please do not harass maintainers.\n\nIf the maintainer chooses to remove the label, let us know so we can re-evaluate your Hacktoberfest account.

    answer: `An "Excluded Project" is a repository which has been blocked by the Hacktoberfest team for being "cheaty" or "spammy".\n\nHacktoberfest is about making valuable contributions to open source, not adding a random algorithm, to a folder, adding a name or similar to "win".\n\nWe recommend searching for things that you use (Such as freeCodeCamp, Notion, zsh or a lot more!). You can also search <#735506115810426971> - we try to keep this clean of all cheaty repos.\n\nYou can read more about what Hacktoberfest is doing to reduce spam at <https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources#reduce-spam>.\n\nFound a repo that you think doesn't follow the values? Report it at <https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/report>.`,
