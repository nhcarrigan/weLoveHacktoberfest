We kindly ask that you just have patience as we work hard to get it all shipped out.\n\nOnce your swag has been shipped you'll get an email from our swag provider, Kotis, with tracking information for your package! Please don't email us asking for tracking before you've got the email, it will automatically be sent to you when your swag gets shipped. Once shipped, delivery is expected to take between 8 - 12 weeks, though, again, given the global health pandemic things might be a bit slower than expected.",

However, we never give out numbers for completions as we go, as itâ€™d incentivise further spam and likely disincentivise legitimate contributions at a point.\n\nPlease keep in mind though that Hacktoberfest isn't just about getting a T-shirt, that is not the core aim for participating in Hacktoberfest. A T-shirt may be motivating to win, but Hacktoberfest is about learning and contributing to open source, doing good for the open-source community and helping projects out, not primarily about getting a free T-shirt.\n\nAlso, if you do win, you should really consider opt-ing to have a tree planted on your behalf in the Hacktoberfest Forest instead of claiming a T-shirt, we need to look after our climate!",
